                In connection with the Services, we have adopted and implemented a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (

                unauthorized
                materials and for the termination of a User's ability to use our Services, in appropriate circumstances,
                if we determine that User is infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe
                that
                a User is, through the use of the Services, unlawfully infringing by submitting unauthorized Content,
                and
                wish to have the allegedly infringing or unauthorized material removed, the following information in the
                form of a written notification (pursuant to 17 U.S.C. ยง 512) must be provided to our designated
                copyright
                agent (

                that
                you claim to have been infringed; identification of the Content on the Services that you claim is
                infringing
                and that you request us to remove; sufficient information to permit us to locate such Content; your
                address,
                telephone number, and e-mail address; a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the
                objectionable
                Content is not authorized by the copyright or other rights owner, its agent, or the law; and a statement
                that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are either
                the
                owner of the copyright or other right that has allegedly been infringed or violated or that you are
                authorized
                to act on behalf of the copyright or other rights owner. Note that, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. ยง 512, any
                misrepresentation
                of material fact in a written notification automatically subjects the complaining party to liability for
                any damages, costs and attorney's fees incurred by us in connection with the written notification and
                allegation
                of copyright infringement.

            <h5>15. Dispute Resolution.</h5>
            <p>
                (a) In the event that any dispute arises with respect to the Services, these Terms, or any of our
                Policies,
                upon our election
                in our sole discretion, such dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the
                Commercial
                Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the
                American
                Arbitration Association, in Middlesex County, New Jersey. In the event we elect not to require that a be
                submitted to binding arbitration as described above, any such dispute shall nevertheless be litigated by
                you and us in the state courts located in Middlesex County, New Jersey or in the U.S. District Court for
                the District of New Jersey, as the case may be. You shall be liable for and shall reimburse us for our

                and fees, including attorneys' fees, in the event any arbitration or litigation arises between us and
                you.
                By using the Services, you irrevocably agree and consent to be bound to personal jurisdiction of and
                venue
                selection in the state courts located in Middlesex County, New Jersey or in the U.S. District Court for
                the
                District of New Jersey as the case may be, whether either arbitration or litigation arises between us
                and
                you. YOU AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION THAT YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES MUST
                COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS
                PERMANENTLY
                BARRED.
                <br />

                PLAINTIFF
                OR
                CLASS USER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE
                DECISION-MAKER MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT
                OTHERWISE
                PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE DECISION-MAKER
                MAY
                AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL
                CLAIMS.

                <br />
                <br /> (c) You agree that irreparable harm to us would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
                these Terms
                were not performed fully by you or were otherwise breached by you, and that money damages are an
                inadequate
                remedy for breach of the Terms because of the difficulty of ascertaining and quantifying the amount of
                damage
                that will be suffered by us in the event that these Terms are not performed in accordance with its
                provisions
                or is otherwise breached. It is accordingly hereby acknowledged that, notwithstanding any provision of
                this
                Section 15, we shall be entitled to petition the courts mentioned in Section 15(a) for an injunction or
                injunctions
                to restrain, enjoin and prevent a failure to perform these Terms by you, without positing bond or other
                security,
                and to enforce specifically such provisions of these Terms.
                <br />
                <br /> (d) Dispute Resolution Severability. If a court decides that any term or provision relating to
                our
                ability
                to submit any above-mentioned dispute to arbitration or to the above class action wavier according to
                this
                Section 15, the parties agree to litigate any such dispute according to Section 15(a) above and to
                replace
                any other such terms or provisions of Section 15(a) or Section 15(b) with a term or provision that is
                valid
                and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
                or
                provision, and this Section 15 shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event of any such severing,
                the
                remainder of these Terms will continue to apply.
            </p>

                foreign
                language version of the Terms, the English language version of these Terms shall govern. All disputes,
                claims
